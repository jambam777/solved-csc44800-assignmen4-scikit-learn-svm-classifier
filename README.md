<ul>

 <li>Compete the two programming exercises described in the following charts.</li>

 <li>Start looking for an interesting dataset for your project.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Programming Exercise A</h1>

<ul>

 <li>Apply the <strong>Scikit Learn SVM Classifier </strong>to the <strong>Iris dataset </strong>using all three categories and all four feature at once and upload your .ipynb file.</li>

 <li>Run the SVM model (at least) four times using a different kernel each time. Compare and discuss the results for each of the kernels.</li>

 <li>Name your file lastname_firstname_AS04A.ipynb.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Programming Exercise B</h1>

<ul>

 <li>Apply the <strong>Scikit Learn Decision Tree Classifier </strong>to the <strong>Iris dataset </strong>using all three categories and all four feature at once and upload your .ipynb file.</li>

 <li>See if your choice of impurity measure makes a difference in your results.</li>

 <li>Name your file lastname_firstname_AS04B.ipynb.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Programming Exercises (both A and B)</h1>

<ul>

 <li>Discuss your findings.</li>

 <li>Include all of your discussion in your .ipynb file and submit the file through Blackboard.</li>

 <li>Do not clear your results after you last run so that I will be able to see your results without rerunning your code.</li>

</ul>
